            <h2>What is the Universal Unit System?</h2>
            <p>
               The Universal Unit System (UUS) is a method created by dance
               legend Skippy Blair that allows dancers to "read" and analyze
               dance rhythms much like a musician reads sheet music.1While most
               dance classes teach students to count to 8 (e.g., "5, 6, 7, 8"),
               Skippy Blair recognized that this often confuses students because
               the actual footwork doesn't always line up neatly with those 8
               beats. Instead, she developed a system based on what your feet
               are actually doing in relation to the music.
            </p>

            <h3>The "Unit" (The 2-Beat Rule)</h3>
            <p>
               The core philosophy of the system is that almost all dance music
               and movement can be broken down into 2-beat increments, called
               "Units. Instead of trying to memorize a long, complex 8-beat
               pattern, the UUS treats a dance pattern like a sentence made up
               of small, 2-beat words. If you can understand these tiny 2-beat
               "words," you can string them together to create any complex dance
               pattern.
            </p>
            <h3>"Sound" vs. "Silence"</h3>
            <p>
               Blair’s system simplifies dance into two states of being. To a
               dancer, "rhythm" is simply the arrangement of weight changes
               (steps) over time.3 Sound (•): You take a step (a weight
               change).Silence (/): You pause or hold (no weight change).
            </p>
            <h3>The Rolling Count ("& a 1, & a 2")</h3>
            <p>
               Most people count "1, 2, 3, 4." Blair argued this makes dancers
               "plod" or march because they only move exactly when the number is
               spoken. The Rolling Count inserts sounds between the beats to
               keep the body moving continuously: "& a 1, & a 2" The "&": This
               is when your Center Point of Balance (CPB) moves. Your body
               starts moving before your foot steps. The "a": This is when your
               foot releases from the floor. The "1": This is when your foot
               strikes the floor (the beat). By using the Rolling Count, dancers
               learn that movement is continuous like a wave, not robotic like a
               ticking clock.
