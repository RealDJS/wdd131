               <h2>What is the Universal Unit System?</h2>
               <p>
                  The Universal Unit System (UUS) is a method created by dance
                  legend Skippy Blair that allows dancers to "read" and analyze
                  dance rhythms much like a musician reads sheet music. While
                  most dance classes teach students to count to 8 (e.g., "5, 6,
                  7, 8"), Skippy Blair recognized that this often confuses
                  students because the actual footwork doesn't always line up
                  neatly with those 8 beats. Instead, she developed a system
                  based on what your feet are actually doing in relation to the
                  music.

               <h3>The "Unit" (The 2-Beat Rule)</h3>
               <p>
                  The core philosophy of the system is that almost all dance
                  music and movement can be broken down into 2-beat increments,
                  called "Units. Instead of trying to memorize a long, complex
                  8-beat pattern, the UUS treats a dance pattern like a sentence
                  made up of small, 2-beat words. If you can understand these
                  tiny 2-beat "words," you can string them together to create
                  any complex dance pattern.
               </p>
               <h3>"Sound" vs. "Silence"</h3>
               <p>
                  Blair's system simplifies dance into two states of being. To a
                  dancer, "rhythm" is simply the arrangement of weight changes
                  (steps) over time. Sound (•): You take a step (a weight
                  change). Silence (/): You pause or hold (no weight change).
               </p>
               <h3>The Rolling Count ("& a 1, & a 2")</h3>
               <p>
                  Most people count "1, 2, 3, 4." Blair argued this makes
                  dancers "plod" or march because they only move exactly when
                  the number is spoken. The Rolling Count inserts sounds between
                  the beats to keep the body moving continuously:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  "& a 1, & a 2"
                  <li>
                     The "&": This is when your Center Point of Balance (CPB)
                     moves. Your body starts moving before your foot steps.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The "a": This is when your foot releases from the floor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The "1": This is when your foot strikes the floor (the
                     beat).
                  </li>
                  The Rolling Count makes movement continuous like a wave rather
                  than robotic like a ticking clock.
               </ul>
